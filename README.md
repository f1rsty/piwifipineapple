# piwifipineapple

This project was inspired by a recent Def Con talk I watched on youtube. I had a raspberry pi sitting around and wanted to make use of it, found several 'tutorials' on how to setup a hotspot, and I decided to write this script to automate the entire process on setting the raspberry pi up as a malicious hot spot for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

Simply download the shell file on a fresh install of raspbian and it should handle everything for you.

### Prerequisites

All that is required is a raspberry pi running raspbian stretch, the installer handles the rest.

### Installing

sudo bash piwifipineapple.sh

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
